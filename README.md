# DearMap Server (Proxy)

This is a lightweight **Node.js + Express** proxy server used in the **DearMap** app to securely call the Foursquare Places API without exposing sensitive API keys on the frontend and to handle CORS issues.

---

## 🔐 Why a Proxy?

Directly calling the Foursquare API from the frontend would expose the API key. This proxy server protects that key and handles all API requests securely.
